# TaskRise

Work in Progress – CLI Version Only  

TaskRise is a personal project in active development. The system is currently implemented as a command-line interface (CLI) application and is not yet intended for any kind of real production use.  

Inspired by an old school project, TaskRise has evolved into a personal initiative in exploring how digital automation can enhance productivity and help users (starting with me) avoid task paralysis by dynamically prioritizing tasks based on **importance, relevance, and timeliness**. While the core functionality exists in this CLI version, the project is still evolving, and features, structure, and design may change significantly in the future.  

This repository serves primarily as a **portfolio demonstration of coding, design, and algorithmic thinking for the time being**.

## Current Features

### Users can:
- Add tasks with type, importance, relevance, and optional description
- Remove tasks
- View top-priority tasks
- Basic priority scoring system based on deadlines, importance, and relevance

## Planned Features

- Completed tasks tracking and management
- Robust Error Handling
- Enhanced user interface and input validation
- More unique and personable interface
- Improved sorting, filtering, and searching
- Persistent storage (database or file system)
- More/Better advanced scoring and prioritization algorithms
- Eventually transition to a modern web application for broader accessibility and productivity improvements
